## About
Hi, I'm Haneul Yoo, an Ph.D. student advised by [Alice Oh](https://aliceoh9.github.io/) at [Users & Information Lab](http://uilab.kr/), [School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/), [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/).
My research interest primarily lies in the intersection of natural language processing and computational social science.
In particular, I mainly work on (1) understanding historical documents in low-resource languages and (2) applying and utilizing NLP in language education.
I believe there are still myriads of underrepresented languages in NLP, and our efforts on low-resource languages can build more culturally-diverse language models.
I also believe language learners can contribute to NLP techniques and data and vice versa.
